# Visual-Brainfuck-Interpreter-VBI
one of the slowest interpreters for brainfuck! complete with visualization!

## BrainFuck:



this interpreter was built because i couldent find a visual interpreter that was not only on the web and i could use it offline. so i made my own!



this brainfuck interpreter is one of the slowest mainly because of two reseaons:

1) this is on python(lets just blame python insted of my bad coding skills)

2) im not the gratest of coders/programers

one of the things asusiated with an interpreters spees, is to test a program with it.
this great peace  of code can run towers of hanoi in...ummm..... im not sure how long. i wanted to test it one time, but it taked more than 1h 10m so i just gave up

```
python main.py examples/hanoi.b
# takes more than 1h 10m
```
